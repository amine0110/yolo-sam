# Yolo-SAM for Medical Imaging

This is a project that creates an AI-assisted medical image annotation tool using PyTorch, tkinter, pydicom, and other libraries. The tool allows users to import DICOM images, create and manipulate bounding boxes, and save their annotations. Additionally, it integrates with an AI model to automatically generate segmentation masks.

The official repo of the SAM model can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything)

## Features
- Import and visualize DICOM images.
- Create, edit, and remove bounding boxes.
- Automatically generate segmentation masks using an AI model.
- Save segmentation masks as DICOM files.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- tkinter
- ttkbootstrap
- pydicom
- dicom2nifti
- pillow
- torchvision

## Usage
- Use the `Open Directory` button to select a folder containing DICOM images.
- Navigate through the images using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
- Click the `Activate Draw` button and draw a bounding box on the image.
- To remove a bounding box, select it and click the `Delete Annotation` button.
- Click the `Launch SAM` button to generate segmentation masks. The AI model will predict the areas of interest within the bounding boxes.
- You can save the segmentation masks as DICOM files by clicking the `Export Segmentation` button. For each image, the tool will create a new DICOM file with the "_seg" suffix. If an image doesn't have any bounding boxes or masks, the tool will create an empty DICOM file.
